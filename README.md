# intro-to-data-science

Welcome to my Intro to Data Science assignment repo. Here you'll find two R Markdown files. One that examines NYC shooting incidents, and one that examines U.S. and global COVID numbers. You will also find already knitted versions of the R Markdown files.

To anyone that needs help downloading the .rmd files, see guide [here](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/download-from-github?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fwebsite%2Fdownload-from-github&hubs_content-cta=downloading%20a%20file). 

Navigate to the .rmd file, and click on the "Raw" button. From there right-click on the page and "Save as...". This should allow you to download the .rmd file.

Thanks!
